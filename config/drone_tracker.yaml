# Custom Object Tracker Configuration for Drone Applications
# Optimized for moving platforms with gimbal-mounted cameras
#
# Based on BoTSORT (Bag of Tricks for Sort) tracker with:
# - Camera motion compensation for drone/gimbal movement
# - Extended track buffer for temporary occlusions
# - Relaxed matching thresholds for large frame-to-frame displacement

tracker_type: bytetrack

# Detection confidence thresholds
track_high_thresh: 0.5     # High confidence detections (primary matching)
track_low_thresh: 0.1      # Low confidence detections (recovery matching)
new_track_thresh: 0.6      # Threshold to create new track

# Track persistence
track_buffer: 30           # Keep lost tracks for 30 frames (~1 second at 30fps)

# Matching thresholds
match_thresh: 0.8          # IoU threshold for matching
fuse_score: true           # Fuse detection confidence with IoU score

# BoTSORT-specific parameters
# Camera motion compensation - critical for drone/gimbal movement
gmc_method: sparseOptFlow  # Options: sparseOptFlow, orb, ecc, none
                           # sparseOptFlow: Fast optical flow for motion compensation

# Association thresholds
proximity_thresh: 0.5      # Distance threshold for first association (relaxed)
appearance_thresh: 0.6     # Appearance similarity threshold (relaxed for view changes)

# ReID (Re-identification) features
with_reid: false          # Disable for performance (ReID is very computationally expensive)
model: auto               # ReID model name/path; "auto" uses detector features
